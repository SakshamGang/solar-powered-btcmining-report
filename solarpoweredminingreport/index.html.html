    <h1>Bitcoin Mining Business Report</h1>
    <h2>Setup Description</h2>
    <p>This report outlines the estimated revenue for a Bitcoin mining operation powered by a solar energy setup. The mining setup consists of 6 Antminer S21 Pro miners, each consuming 3500 watts per hour, equating to 84 kWh per day per miner. For 6 miners, the total daily energy consumption is 504 kWh.</p>
    <p>A 5 to 6 ton air conditioning unit is required, consuming approximately 180 kWh per day when running 24 hours.</p>
    <p>The solar farm is a 255 kWp setup, generating approximately 3.29 units (kWh) per kW per day, resulting in a total daily energy production of about 838.95 kWh. This provides sufficient energy for the setup, with some excess capacity. Although up to 7 miners could be supported, 6 miners are used for safety.</p>
    <p>Mining is conducted in Antpool with a pool fee of 2.5%. Each Antminer S21 Pro has a hash rate of 234 TH/s.</p>

    <h2>Estimated Revenue Report</h2>
    <p>The following estimates are based on current Bitcoin network conditions, including a network hash rate of approximately 954 EH/s and a Bitcoin price of 111,274 USD per BTC. Daily BTC production is calculated before and after the pool fee, with revenue converted to USD.</p>

            <td>27,349.45 USD</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>Note: These are estimates and actual revenue may vary based on changes in network hash rate, Bitcoin price, transaction fees, and other factors. Energy costs are assumed to be zero due to solar power.</p>
